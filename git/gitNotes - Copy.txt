Distributed Version Control
Fully mirror central repository locally

Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git
- snapshot taken of all files and stores reference to snapshot
- unchanged files just link to previous version

nearly every operation is local

ANY file change detected by git
mechanism called checksumming : SHA-1
SHA-1 is essentially key to git database

git has 3 main file states
- modified
  - changed but not commited to local database
- staged
  - modified file has been marked in it's current version to go into next commit snapshot
- commited
  - data safely stored in local database
  
git project has 3 main sections
- git directory
  - metadata and object database for project. Cloning creates this
- working directory
  - single checkout of 1 version of project
  - These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
  - files in working directory are in 1 of 2 states
    - tracked : files in last snapshot? Can have status of modified, unmodified, staged
	- untracked : everything else
  - file status lifecycle:
    (untracked) -> add file -> (unmodified) -> edit file -> (modified) -> stage file -> (staged)
	                           (unmodified) <---------------------------- commit file <- (staged)
- staging area
  - details what goes into next commit
  
The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
- You modify files in your working directory.
- You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.
- You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.

git help



EOL considerations
==================
CR: ^M
LF: ^J

Windows uses CR LF at eol
Unix uses LF only

core.autocrlf true

file from git(unix) -> windows : LF -> CRLF
file from windows to git(unix) : CRLF -> LF




git status
details of most recent commit
-----------------------------
My most recent commit referred to as HEAD
git show
git show --name-only



Differences
===========
eg - what have I changed but not staged? git diff
   - what have I staged and am about to commit? git diff --staged (or --cached)
   
git diff <commit#> <commit#>
git diff --name-only <commit#> <commit#>

- need to know differences between my local code and latest pull from repo - CONFIRM THIS
git diff HEAD
git diff -- staged
   

  
  finding branch of commit
  ------------------------
  git branch --contains SHA1
  


  To find common ancestor of 2 
  ----------------------------
  git merge-base <branch> <branch>
 

Interactive rebasing - squashing commits
========================================
eg
git log (master)
m1
m2

git log (branch)
m1
m2
b1
b2
b3
b4

I want to squash the 4 branch commits into 1 commit

git rebase -i HEAD~4
'pick' 1st commit
'squash' rest of commits
	  
	  
Stashing
========
Can't cleanly switch branches with messy working directory

  stash working directory
  -----------------------
  git stash
  
  view stash stack
  ----------------
  git stash list
  
  apply stash
  -----------
  git stash apply
  
  
b4 merge can try git diff <src_branch> <tgt branch>
