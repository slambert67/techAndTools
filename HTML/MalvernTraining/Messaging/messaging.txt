
Messaging
---------
Same origin policy
Origin : scheme(protocol) + host(www.mycompany.com) + port

workaround using proxy. (slower). Proxy can communicate with different servers
Messaging better
- server sent events (unidirectional)
  - push from server to browser in form of DOM events
  - Javascript API called eventSource
- web sockets (bi directional) - more complicated
- cross document messaging
  - Message event has 2 important properties
    - data that contains message
	- origin of message
	
XMLHttpRequest (XHR) Level 2
- main Javascript API to do Ajax
