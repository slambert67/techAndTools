misc notes
==========
post needed to create id
get guaranteed not to make change
REST = http and following conventions

POST Form Data : name=newbie&grade=A : telnet to server
Add ?name=x&grade=y to url is equivalent

=========


http message
- header
  - metadata
  - request contains http methods
- body

We often say you send the request for a resource to a host. 
The host is included in the header separately from the resource path, which comes right on top of the request header:

GET /clients/jim HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

Resources are best thought of as nouns (REST)

HTTP Verbs
==========
Each request specifies a certain HTTP verb, or method, in the request header

GET
---
Server data never modified

PUT
---
Create or update resource

PUT /clients/robin

PUT requests contain data to use in updating or creating resource

DELETE
------
Delete a resource

POST
----
used when the processing you wish to happen on the server should be repeated if the POST request is repeated (not idempotent)
should cause processing of the request body as a subordinate of the URL you are posting to

  POST /clients should not cause resource /clients itself to be modified but a resource with a url that starts with /clients
                eg append new client to list with id generated by server
				
Safe Methods
------------
Never modify resources
GET

Unsafe Methods
--------------
PUT, DELETE

Idempotent Methods
------------------
Achieve same result no matter how many times request is repeated
GET, PUT, DELETE

Http Response
-------------
Should specify content type of body
Content/Type: application/json
