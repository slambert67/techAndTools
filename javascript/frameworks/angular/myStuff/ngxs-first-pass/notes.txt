4 major concepts

Store: Global state container, action dispatcher and selector
Actions: Class describing the action to take and its associated metadata
State: Class definition of the state
Selects: State slice selectors

Implementation
==============
Define interfaces to represent data model. TodoModel.ts, TodoStateModel.ts
Define the state slice. @State, @Action (Our states listen to actions via an @Action decorator). todo-state.ts
Define Action classes. todo-actions.ts
Define Selectors. @Selector determines relevant state. Selectors are calculated when state changes. todo-selectors.ts
Specify the state slices. NgxsModule. app.module.ts
