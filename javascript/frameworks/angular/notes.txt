Setup
=====
1. Install Node
---------------
uninstall npm - npm uninstall -g npm

nodejs.org
node -v shows currently installed version
npm -v (node package manager)
installed to C:/Program Files/nodejs
added to PATH

2. Install IDE
--------------
VS Code or Webstorm

3. Angular CLI
--------------
cli.angular.io

ngis command to run cli
ng -v gives version

npm install @angular/cli (scoped package name - @group/package)
npm install @angular/cli    -> installs in current directory
npm install @angular/cli -g -> installs globally

npm root -g
C:\Users\steve.lambert\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules


Create Project
==============
ng new first-project

Run the project
===============
ng serve
- creates simple http server
- hosts new project

url:  http://localhost:4200/


What was created?
=================
Root component in tree - placeholder for more lower level components
Component is combination of view and backing logic
This component is rendering the default angular page
Root page is index.html referring to root component (src/app - app.module.ts, 
                                                               app.component.css
                                                                             html
                                                                             ts
                                                                             .spec.ts - testing)

app.component.html - {{ title }} <- app.component.ts - title = 'first-project'


Create new sub component
========================
Can create the required files manually or use cli
ng generate component hello-world
files created in src/app/hello-world
app.module.ts modified to import/register/recognise this new component
selector defined in hello-world.component.ts
add selector tag to app.component.html - <app-hello-world></app-hello-world>
can use multiple times - how are they differentiated?


Create new date component (needs js/ts functionality)
=====================================================
ng generate component date
created in app/date
selector defined in date.component.ts


Components
==========
Every Angular component is mainly a Typescript class.
HTML and CSS are basically attachments to this
This class needs to be registered as an Angular component
- so add meta data to class - annotation/decorator
- @Component <- takes object with properties


Binding data from component class
=================================
In html: {{ member variable name }}
View automatically renders the value in the class instance - one way data binding


Template Interpolation
======================
{{}} - Triggers Angular to do interpolation (string, expression etc)
Interprets text in {{}} as something to be evaluated
So not necessarily just a reference to a component variable
e.g.
{{ 1+1 }}
{{ someNumber + 1 }}
{{ addTwoNumbers(6,7) }}
{{ addTwoNumbers(someNumber,7) }}
Note that 'this' is not required


Looping with ngFor
==================
Known as a directive - an attribute added to an element
Determine html element to repeat
<p *ngFor="let phoneNumber of user.phone">{{phoneNumber}}</p>
loops over user.phone which is an array defined in component


ngIf
====
Element removed from DOM if expression evaluates to false


Passing inputs to components
============================
import angular/core/Input into component

declare input parameter
- @Input('nameInTemplate') nameInComponent: string;
- then use this.nameInComponent

pass value where component used: app.component.html
<app-address-card-params suppliedName="new name"></app-address-card-params>

associate suppliedName with component member variable
@Input('suppliedName') username: String='';

interpolate in html view
<p>{{username}}</p>


Using ngOnInit Lifecycle hook
=============================
Certain lifecycle events
Constructor executes when html element refers to an angular component
Populates member values after this
ngOnInit called when instance created and initialised
Lifecycle hooks made available to us with the use of interfaces (can act as compile time checks)

*** See angular documentation for other lifecycle hooks ***


Passing member variables to components
======================================
app.component.html
<app-address-card [user]="user"></app-address-card>
[] => "user" refers to user object defined in app.component.ts
[user] refers to input variable defined in sub component
"user" refers to instance name in parent component


Styling Components
==================
.name refers to all name classes but want to confine to our component.
could use .address-card .name
But, in Angular, the CSS applies only to it's component. Angular adds it's own properties to implement this.
Project root has src/styles.css for global styles


Handling Click Events
=====================
Surround usual browser event with ()
(click)="toggleCollapse()"


Two way data binding with ngModel
=================================
{{}} -> string interpolation - always a string
[]   -> binding. Preserves type. Useful for assigning html element attributes

<input type="text" ngModel="inputText">
ngModel requires a module import - to be discussed later
app.module.ts : import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="inputText"> => two way data binding on inputText
[()] - banana in a box
[] - pick up value from component and use in view.      Component -> View
() - pick up value/event in view and pass to component. View -> Component


Creating and using multiple modules
===================================
Project can contain multiple modules
Module consolidates(?) different components
Feature modules - group of related components

ngModule annotation (decorator?) denotes a class as being an angular module

declarations -> components that are a part of this module
imports -> specify dependencies on other modules

ng generate module <name>
- folder created in src/app

ng generate component view/view-component

parent module imports child module
child module must still export it's components

import at top of file is a typescript import - types/classes must be imported
within ngmodule it is an angular import


Creating a Service
==================
ng generate service <name>
created in src/app
has @Injectable annotation
c.f. @Component, @NgModule
No update to *.module.ts - because not obvious where a developer will be using a Service
So must be declared manually in modules that will be using it
Defined in providers[] array property
Now available for components to use


Dependency Injection
====================
Easy initialisation of classes (and classes that depend on other classes)
Framework handles object creation and injects the service into the component requiring it
Define constructor parameter to hold injected service
Assign to member variable so available to the whole component

constructor( private svc: TestService ) {}
- shortcut to create svc member variable


Service Injection Context
=========================
Components & Services work differently in the context of modules

components
- declared inside modules
- available only to other components in the module
- add to module exports so available to other modules
- other modules have to import
summary for component to be used outside it's module
- owning module must export
- using module must import

Services
- listed in module providers array
- Injected into component
- Inner components also have access
- SERVICES ARE NOT RESTRICTED TO THE MODULE THEY ARE DECLARED IN!
- There is a common shared space for Services - Service Injection Context
- So why not declare in ANY module? Lazy Loading

Lazy Loading
- Affects how Service Injection Context works
- We've explicitly loaded modules so far (I think - imports)
- Another way is Lazy Loading - multiple Injection Contexts
- Therefore different instances of a Service - which instance do I get. *** RESEARCH LATER ***


Making REST calls with HttpClient
=================================
HttpClient service available out of the box
Import module that this service comes with - HttpClientModule
Makes sense to import this service from root module

app.module.ts
-------------
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; <- TS import of module
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    HttpClientModule,
    ViewModule
  ],

app.component.ts
----------------
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; <- TS import of service

  // I need TestService and HttpClient service
  constructor(private svc: TestService, private http: HttpClient) {
    this.svc.printToConsole('Got the service');
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    // asynchronous operation. asynchronous object returned called an observable (Promise in angularJS)
    let obs = this.http.get('https://api.github.com/users/koushikkothagal');
    obs.subscribe( (response: any) => console.log(response));
    console.log('This prints before result from asynchronous request');
  }


Extending the sample application
================================
response may be used in view after a search for example
but response object not available on initialisation
So
<div *ngIf="restResponse">
    {{restResponse.login}}
</div>
or
response?.login


Binding summary
===============
<h1>Binding project is up and running</h1>

<p>This is just some view text - no binding</p>

<!-- 
  View automatically renders the value in the class instance member variable 
  String / expression interpolation etc
  Interprets text in {{}} as something to be evaluated
  Note that 'this' is not required
-->
<h5>One way bound with double curly brackets</h5>
<p>{{var1}}</p>

<h5>Array values accessed by specifying index</h5>
<p>{{arr1[0]}} - {{arr1[1]}}</p>

<!--
  Member variable accessed directly within <p>. {{}} not needed?
-->
<h5>Array values accessed using ngfor</h5>
<p *ngFor="let entry of arr1">{{entry}}</p>

<!-- 
  sub component 
  Pass hard coded value to sub component - use an attribute
  c.f. <img src="xyz">
  code subcomponent to accept this as input
-->
<h5>Hard coded value passed in</h5>
<app-sub squoink="value of squoink"></app-sub>

<!--
  Pass member variable of parent to sub component
  [] tells angular to treat entry in quotes as a member variable
  simple string here but works with objects
-->
<h5>Member variable value passed in</h5>
<app-sub [squoink]="var1"></app-sub>

<!--
  Try interpolation
-->
<h5>Member variable passed in using interpolation</h5>
<app-sub squoink="{{var1}}"></app-sub>

<!--
  View updating data in component and then reflected back in view where appropriate
  ngModel requires import of standard angular module
-->
<h5>Two way data binding</h5>
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="inputText1">
{{inputText1}}

<!-- 
  one way from view to component 
  Not sure how
-->


Building an Angular project
===========================
ng serve
- looks at codebase
- bundles up modules
- creates local server (dev server)
  - lots of js files loaded
  - not minified
  - not consolidated
- need optimisations when deploying
- deployed as 3 files: html, css, js
- ng build bundles files
- files stored in dist folder
- Need to run in production mode for optimisations
- ng build --prod
- also does AOT - ahead of time compilation
  - templates compiled. Angular compiler not downloaded when page is accessed
