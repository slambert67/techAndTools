Create Project
==============
ng new first-project

Run the project
===============
ng serve
- creates simple http server
- hosts new project

url:  http://localhost:4200/


What was created?
=================
Root component in tree - placeholder for more lower level components
Component is combination of view and backing logic
This component is rendering the default angular page
Root page is index.html referring to root component (src/app - app.module.ts, 
                                                               app.component.css
                                                                             html
                                                                             ts
                                                                             .spec.ts - testing)

app.component.html - {{ title }} <- app.component.ts - title = 'first-project'


Create new sub component
========================
Can create the required files manually or use cli
ng generate component hello-world
files created in src/app/hello-world
app.module.ts modified to import/register/recognise this new component
selector defined in hello-world.component.ts
add selector tag to app.component.html - <app-hello-world></app-hello-world>
can use multiple times - how are they differentiated?


Create new date component (needs js/ts functionality)
=====================================================
ng generate component date
created in app/date
selector defined in date.component.ts


Components
==========
Every Angular component is mainly a Typescript class.
HTML and CSS are basically attachments to this
This class needs to be registered as an Angular component
- so add meta data to class - annotation/decorator
- @Component <- takes object with properties
