you can bind your view's render function to the model's "change" event — 
and now everywhere that model data is displayed in the UI, it is always immediately up to date.
How???

banner_ui_ss calls render on a view that doesn't have one defined? mixins may answer this?

when do we use table and when do we use ul - depends on requirement.

edit
====
backbone.grid. xe extension see backbone.grid.js

why use params when name= works for controllers

templates
=========
piece of html - has structure of view
fill in model data at runtime

allows for non searching for html elements at runtime
