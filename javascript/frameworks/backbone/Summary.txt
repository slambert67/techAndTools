Model
=====
- single instance
- validation
- allows persistence to database
- multiple views may observe it for changes
- view informed when model updated - screen view kept in sync with model
- model doesn't care about view. Just announces it has changed through framework event system

Collection
==========
- groups models together
- individual model identified by idAttribute. Defaults to id but could be userId etc
- collection announces change
- therefore don't need to manually observe individual model instances

View
====
- view generally has an associated model and listens for changes in that model and then re-rendering
- can define ui events
