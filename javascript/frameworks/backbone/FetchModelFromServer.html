// Collections.fetch() retrieves a set of models from the server in the form of a JSON array 
// by sending an HTTP GET request to the URL specified by the collection's url property (which may be a function). 
// When this data is received, a set() will be executed to update the collection.
  
var Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {

var TodosCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({

todos.fetch(); // sends HTTP GET to /todos

// Saving models to the server
// While Backbone can retrieve an entire collection of models from the server at once, 
// updates to models are performed individually using the model's save() method. 
// When save() is called on a model that was fetched from the server, 
// it constructs a URL by appending the model's id to the collection's URL and sends an HTTP PUT to the server. 
// If the model is a new instance that was created in the browser (i.e., it doesn't have an id) 
// then an HTTP POST is sent to the collection's URL. Collections.create() can be used to create a new model, 
// add it to the collection, and send it to the server in a single method call.

var Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    title: '',
    completed: false
  }
});

var TodosCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Todo,
  url: '/todos'
});

var todos = new TodosCollection();
todos.fetch();

var todo2 = todos.get(2);
todo2.set('title', 'go fishing');
todo2.save(); // sends HTTP PUT to /todos/2

todos.create({title: 'Try out code samples'}); // sends HTTP POST to /todos and adds to collection

// As mentioned earlier, a model's validate() method is called automatically by save() and will trigger 
// an invalid event on the model if validation fails.

//Deleting models from the server

// A model can be removed from the containing collection and the server by calling its destroy() method. 
// Unlike Collection.remove() which only removes a model from a collection, Model.destroy() will also send an 
// HTTP DELETE to the collection's URL.

var Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    title: '',
    completed: false
  }
});

var TodosCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Todo,
  url: '/todos'
});

var todos = new TodosCollection();
todos.fetch();

var todo2 = todos.get(2);
todo2.destroy(); // sends HTTP DELETE to /todos/2 and removes from collection

// Options

// Each RESTful API method accepts a variety of options. 
// Most importantly, all methods accept success and error callbacks which can be used to customize the handling of server responses. 
// Specifying the {patch: true} option to Model.save() will cause it to use HTTP PATCH to send only the changed attributes to 
// the server instead of the entire model. Similarly, passing the {reset: true} option to Collection.fetch() will result in the 
// collection being updated using reset() rather than set().

// See the Backbone.js documentation for full descriptions of the supported options.
