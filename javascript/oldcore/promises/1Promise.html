    Callback problem 
    - Inversion of Control (Trusting external source)
    - Callback UNDER CONTROL OF EXTERNAL SOURCE!
    - we're saying "here's what happens later after current step finishes"
    
    Promises
    - easily repeatable mechanism for encapsulating and composing future values
    - uninvert the inversion of control
    - instead of handing continuation of our program to external source
      we expect it to let us know when the task is finished
      our own code can then decide what to do with the callback functionality
    - most new async APIs built on promises

      /**
      Promise analogy 1 : Future Value
      ================================
      - cf. receipt for cheeseburger order
      - can reason 'about' future value (placeholder) without knowing it yet
      - value can be thought of as time independent
      - order / receipt number called : NB in real world may not be called - unresolved state
        - cheeseburger ready: once future value ready, exchange value promise (receipt) for it: success
        - out of cheeseburgers: failure
      
      x+y ASSUMES both x and y have resolved to a value
      nonsense to expect + operator to handle waiting around for x and y to be resolved
      code as if both operands are future values:
      add() {
        getx() {
          if y != undefined return x+y else x
        }
        gety() {
          if x != undefined return x+y else y
        }
      }
      So:
      - add is now temporally consistent - behaves same across now and later times
      - to consistently handle now and later then make both of them later. All operations become async
      
      Promise Value
      -------------
      Because Promises encapsulate the time-dependent state -- waiting on the fulfillment or rejection of the underlying value -- from the outside, 
      the Promise itself is time-independent, and thus Promises can be composed (combined) in predictable ways regardless of the timing or outcome underneath.

      Moreover, once a Promise is resolved, it stays that way forever -- it becomes an immutable value at that point -- 
      and can then be observed as many times as necessary.

      Promise analogy 2 : Completion Event
      ====================================
      - flow control mechanism. Temporal this-then-that for 2 or more steps in asynchronous task
      
      suppose we need to know when foo() finishes so we can continue
      can think in terms of events
      can reframe our need for notification as a need to listen for a completion (or continuation) event emitted by foo
      with callbacks, the notification would be our callback invoked by foo
      Promises flip the relationship - listen for event from foo and when received process accordingly
        
      Pseudocode:
      function foo(x) {
	    // start doing something that could take a while

	    // make a `listener` event notification
	    // capability to return

	    return listener; // restore control back to calling code
      }

      var evt = foo( 42 );

      evt.on( "completion", function(){
	    // now we can do the next step!
      } );

      evt.on( "failure", function(err){
	    // oops, something went wrong in `foo(..)`
      } );
      
      Essentially, evt object is a neutral third-party negotiation between the separate concerns
      
      Promise Events
      --------------
      function foo(x) {
        // start doing something that could take a while
        
        // construct and return a Promise
        // pattern known as revealing constructor
        return new Promise( function(resolve,reject) {  -- executed synchronously and NOT asynchronously
          // eventually call resolve or reject
          // which are the resolution callbacks for the promise
        });
      }
      var p = foo( 42 );
      bar( p );
      baz( p );

      function bar(fooPromise) {
	    // listen for `foo(..)` to complete
	    fooPromise.then(
		  function(){
			// `foo(..)` has now finished, so
			// do `bar(..)`'s task
		  },
		  function(){
			// oops, something went wrong in `foo(..)`
	 	  }
        );
      }
      // ditto for `baz(..)`
