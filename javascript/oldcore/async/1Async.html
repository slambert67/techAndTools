      - 2 processes can be running concurrently (in parallel)
        - events created by these processes can be interleaved on event queue
        - so processes are concurrent but individual events execute sequentially
        - Interaction of processes:
          - NO: Nondeterminism is acceptable
          - YES: 
            - interaction possibly through scope or DOM
            - interactions need coordinating to prevent race conditions
