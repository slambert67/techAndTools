Every file is a module
CommonJS modules have an implicit local scope
global scope needs to be accesses explicitly
export and import can be dynamic?
require used to resolve dependencies
require function calls are synchronous and return the interface exposed by the module
require function takes a module identifier
A CommonJS module has an object called module provided by node

e.g.
const fs = require('fs');          // fs module is part of node core
const hi = require('./sayHi.js');  // module retrieved from file system
