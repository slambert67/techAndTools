    - Importance
    - Specificity
    - Source order

    <h2>Importance</h2>
    <!--
    Conflicting declarations will be applied in the following order, with later ones overriding earlier ones in importance:
    - Declarations in user agent style sheets (e.g. the browser's default styles, used when no other styling is set).
    - Normal declarations in user style sheets (custom styles set by a user).
    - Normal declarations in author style sheets (these are the styles set by us, the web developers).
    - Important declarations in author style sheets
    - Important declarations in user style sheets

    <h2>Specificity</h2>
    <!--
    The amount of specificity a selector has is measured using four different values (or components), 
    which can be thought of as thousands, hundreds, tens and ones â€” four single digits in four columns:

    - Thousands: Score one in this column if  the declaration is inside a style attribute (such declarations don't have selectors, so their specificity is always simply 1000.) Otherwise 0.
    - Hundreds: Score one in this column for each ID selector contained inside the overall selector.
    - Tens: Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.
    - Ones: Score one in this column for each element selector or pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.
