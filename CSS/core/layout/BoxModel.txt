Everything is a box

Padding: Space around sides of an elements content.
         Transparent
		 Reveals elements background colour
		 
Border: Appearance of border on each side of element.
        Encloses content and padding.
		Generally a coloured or translucent line
		Possibly rounded corners
		
Margin: Affects space to side of an element

Outline: Like border but doesn't change space a box takes
         Added outside element's border
         Generally leave alone

Display ordering
- margin & background colour at the back
- background image
- padding
- border

Elements with display:block
---------------------------
Follow each other vertically down the page
Default width is width of containing element
Default height is height required to contain box content
Width and height apply to content so padding adds to these dimensions
Intrinsic dimensions can be changed by properties width and height	
Can now choose if width and height refer to default content-box or more intuitive border-box
If 2 vertical margins touch, only the largest margin is used

Positioning schemes
-------------------
position: static;  default and known as normal flow. One box after another vertically
position: relative;
position: absolute;
position: fixed;
