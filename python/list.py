# define a list and print it to screen
myFamily = ['mum', 'dad', 'jasmine']
print() # blank line
print('My Family') # note that this is in quotes and so is just a string. NOT the same thing as the list called myFamily
print(myFamily)

# remove the last entry from my list and print new list to screen
myFamily.pop() # remove Jasmine!
print() # blank line
print('Get rid of Jasmine!')
print(myFamily)
