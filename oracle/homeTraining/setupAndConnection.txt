SYS, SYSTEM, PDBADMIN password : usual

In Oracle Database Free (23ai Free)
You get 1 root container (CDB$ROOT).
You get 1 pluggable database by default (usually called FREEPDB1).
If you connect as sysdba without specifying a service, you’ll land in the CDB root.
To use your schemas/tables, you connect to the PDB service (e.g., FREEPDB1).




SQL Developer
-------------
Connection - object specifying required information
Reads any Connections defined in tnsnames.ora

sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1 as sysdba
sqlplus userid=scott/tiger@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1

SQL Developer connection
	name						sltest
	authentication type			default
	username					sys
	role						sysdba
	password					usual
	hostname					localhost
	post						1521
	service name				FREEPDB1
	
	

TNS - Transparent Network Substrate
---
Oracle’s proprietary network protocol layer.
It sits between the application (like SQL*Plus or an Oracle client library) and the underlying transport protocol (like TCP/IP, IPC, or named pipes).
Abstract the underlying network protocol so Oracle tools can work across different platforms without changing code
Manage connection details such as host, port, and service name through configuration files like tnsnames.ora

tnsnames.ora
	A local text file that maps TNS aliases (friendly names) to full connect descriptors
	Found typically in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/ (Linux/Unix) or %ORACLE_HOME%\network\admin\ (Windows).
	
	sqlplus user@MYDB
		instead of
	sqlplus user@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=freepdb1)))
	




SYS
---
username
highest privileged administrative account
owns data dictionary
treated specially as so powerful

@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1 - EZCONNECT style connect string
	localhost - my machine
	1521 - default Oracle listerner port
	FREEPDB1 - service name (PDB inside CDB). So PDB name is FREEPDB1

as sysdba		make connection with SYSDBA privilege.
				Not a normal Role. Elevated administrative privilege. startup / shutdown. Bypass normal authentication
				Effectively Oracle superuser for that session
				SYSDBA authentication
					Password file 
						(REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE=EXCLUSIVE or SHARED then SYS/password@... as sysdba will use that)
					OS Authentication
						sqlplus / as sysdba
						OS user in appropriate OSDBA group
							Bypasses network entirely
						Connected logically as SYS 
					
			

tnsnames.ora
------------
located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory
directory specified by the TNS_ADMIN environment variable or registry value
can specify location in the actual DB

powershell
	if ($env:TNS_ADMIN) { $f=Join-Path $env:TNS_ADMIN 'tnsnames.ora'; if (Test-Path $f) { "TNS_ADMIN override: $f" } else { "TNS_ADMIN is '$env:TNS_ADMIN' but tnsnames.ora not found there" } } else { Get-ChildItem Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\KEY_* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | ForEach-Object { $p=Get-ItemProperty $_.PSPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; if ($p.ORACLE_HOME) { $c=Join-Path $p.ORACLE_HOME 'network\admin\tnsnames.ora'; if (Test-Path $c) { "Found: $c" } } } }
	Found: C:\app\steve\product\23ai\dbhomeFree\network\admin\tnsnames.ora

SID - System Identifier
---
uniquely identifies a running Oracle instance on a host
Tied to a specific memory set + background processes (an instance) running a database.
Used internally by Oracle to distinguish between multiple instances on the SAME server
Usually a short string, e.g., ORCLCDB, FREE, TESTDB
In listener.ora / tnsnames.ora: Specified in SID_NAME
bypasses the service layer and goes straight to the instance.


Service
-------
A logical name that represents one or more database instances offering the same workload
In single-instance DBs: usually just one service equals one database.
In RAC (Real Application Clusters): a service can span multiple instances, and load balancing can occur between them.
In multitenant databases: each PDB (pluggable database) has its own service name(s), and the container database (CDB) also has its own
Often looks like FREEPDB1, orclpdb.mydomain.com, etc
In listener.ora / tnsnames.ora: Specified in SERVICE_NAME
Connecting via service name lets Oracle route your session through the listener to any instance registered for that service.
This is the recommended modern approach.


lsnrctl status gives service and sid details

FREE is the default service name for your container database (CDB) in Oracle Database Free.
If you connect to this service, you’ll be in the root container (CDB$ROOT)
sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/FREE as sysdba

FREEXDB is the XDB (XML Database) service that comes with Oracle by default
mainly used for Oracle XML DB, HTTP(S) access, or WebDAV connections
You typically don’t use this for normal SQL*Plus or application connections unless you specifically need XDB features

freepdb1 is the default pluggable database (PDB) created during installation.
This is where you’d put your user schemas and application data — this is where most people connect.
sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/freepdb1 as sysdba
When connected here, you’re inside the FREEPDB1 container, not the root


handler
-------
endpoint inside listener process that knows how to accept incoming client connections for a service.
In Oracle, most common handlers are:
	Dedicated server handler — launches a new server process for each client connection
	Shared server handler (dispatcher) — uses a pool of server processes for multiple clients (if configured).
	
On a fresh Oracle Free install, you normally see two handlers for a service because:
	One is for TCP/IP connections ((PROTOCOL=TCP)) — the standard way SQL*Plus and most apps connect
	One is for IPC (Inter-Process Communication) — used for local (same machine) connections without going over TCP, and sometimes for background communication between Oracle processes.
	
LOCAL SERVER → IPC handler

REMOTE SERVER → TCP handler


Variables set in installation
-----------------------------

ORACLE_HOME					Path to Oracle installation, e.g., C:\app\<user>\product\23.0.0\dbhomeFree.
ORACLE_SID					Default instance name (FREE)
PATH						Updated to include %ORACLE_HOME%\bin for command-line tools
TNS_ADMIN (optional)		Directory containing tnsnames.ora.
ORACLE_BASE					Base Oracle directory, e.g., C:\app\<user>


Possibly not set - Oracle can get information from the registry
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\KEY_<OracleHomeName>

powershell
	Get-ItemProperty -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\KEY_*' | Select-Object ORACLE_HOME

		FREE
	Get-ItemProperty -Path 'Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\KEY_*' | Select-Object TNS_ADMIN
