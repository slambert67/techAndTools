types
=====
string - simplest type to associate with a key
json - json.set, json.get
lists - lists of strings sorted by insertion order
sets - are unordered collections of unique strings
hashes - are record types modeled as collections of field-value pairs
streams - data structure that acts like an append-only log

if value is of type string -> GET <key>
if value is of type hash -> HGET or HMGET or HGETALL <key>
if value is of type lists -> lrange <key> <start> <end>
if value is of type sets -> smembers <key>
if value is of type sorted sets -> ZRANGEBYSCORE <key> <min> <max>
if value is of type stream -> xread count <count> streams <key> <ID>. https://redis.io/commands/xread
