Mocking is a technique to isolate test subjects by replacing dependencies with objects that you can control and inspect.
A dependency can be anything your subject depends on, but it is typically a module that the subject imports.
When we talk about mocking in Jest, we’re typically talking about replacing dependencies with the Mock Function

The Mock function
-----------------
The goal for mocking is to replace something we don’t control with something we do, so it’s important that what we replace it with has all the features we need.
The mock function provides features to
- capture calls
- set return values
- change the implementation






npm test - run tests

module1 - test simple public function
module2 - jest.fn
module3 - jest.spyOn
