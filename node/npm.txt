prerequisites
-------------
Install node. This installs npm


create a new project
--------------------
npm init -y : create package.json. -y => no questions to answer
Actually creating a new npm package
Think of as meta data about project being developed
Default entry point : index.js


which npm version
-----------------
npm -v


install and use a library
-------------------------
npm install <module/dependency> 
e.g. npm install moment (a date & time library)
- node_modules folder created. Currently contains moment.js etc
- dependencies object in package.json updated with moment specified as a dependency

index.js can now use require to use moment.js functionality
let moment = require('moment');

npm install -D <module> : dev dependency

Packages installed at top level of hierarchy
Installed at lower level if need to be overridden


node_modules
------------
Delete before transferring to others
Other dev just types: npm install
- looks at package.json
- identifies dependencies
- pulls down all the code into node_modules


package.json
------------
"scripts" object used to define aliases (or scripts to run)
e.g. "start":"node index.js"
invoke: npm start
start and test are reserved names for lifecycle scripts

personal script invoked differently
e.g.
"myscript":"ls"
npm run myscript
